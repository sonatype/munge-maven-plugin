Munge is a purposely-simple Java preprocessor. It only supports
conditional inclusion of source based on defined strings of the
form "if[tag]", "if_not[tag]", "else[tag], and "end[tag]".
Unlike traditional preprocessors, comments, and formatting are all
preserved for the included lines. This is on purpose, as the output
of Munge will be distributed as human-readable source code.

To avoid creating a separate Java dialect, the conditional tags are
contained in Java comments. This allows one build to compile the
source files without pre-processing, to facilitate faster incremental
development. Other builds from the same source have their code contained
within that comment. The format of the tags is a little verbose, so
that the tags won't accidentally be used by other comment readers
such as javadoc. Munge tags must be in C-style comments;
C++-style comments may be used to comment code within a comment.

Like any preprocessor, developers must be careful not to abuse its
capabilities so that their code becomes unreadable. Please use it
as little as possible.
